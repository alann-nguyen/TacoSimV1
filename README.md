# TacoSimV1

TacoSimV1 is a program designed to simulate different taco orders, estimated caloric intake and rating different combinations. We mainly made this for fun, since we are still learning how to code properly.
Some parts of the code are file specific, so when running the program switch the file location of certain images for the program to run properly!
